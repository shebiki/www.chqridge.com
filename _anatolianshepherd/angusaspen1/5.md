Puppy #5 is a dark fawn w/ black mask male. He has a smudge of white on his muzzle. He is the darkest pup from this litter. As you can see from his early pictures, he has already lightened considerably as most Anatolians will until they reach maturity. This little guy is also the friendliest so far. He is always the leader of group to greet us each day!
