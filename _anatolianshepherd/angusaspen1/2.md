title: Puppy 2 "Chili"
litter: angusaspen1
---

Chili is an active and friendly pup. Although he welcomes affection, he is more interested in playing with his siblings than being a lap dog. He should make an excellent livestock guardian! Chili has the roughest coat in the litter. We expect his hair to be longer than either of his parents.

Price with full AKC registration is $600 or limited AKC registration is $400.
